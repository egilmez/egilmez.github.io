    <h1>Hello there</h1>
    <h6>2021-03-18</h6>
    <h2>This is my first blog post, awfully and unshamefully written in html. because i'm too lazy for jekyll template.</h2>
    <br>
    <h3> I want to try few things out, and as I try them out, my plan is to post them here. Just for fun probably. If you havent noticed already, 
        there is a <a href="../map.html">map</a> that I made that is an old map over google maps.
    </h3>
    <h3>There are also some random things like some other maps but they are mostly for fun and can be ignored. Ah, and at the <a href="../index.html">home page</a>  there is this lengendary
        Portuguese football player <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Quaresma">Quaresma</a>.
    </h3>
    <br>
    <h3>
        There are few things that fascinate me, and one of them is Spanish cusine, which I like a lot. I also studied EE and was enjoying signal processing and DSP 
        courses a lot, but then I didn't get a chance to work on that kind of stuff. My goal is to re-learn some stuff that I didn't do for years, try to publish some
        interesting tutorials and things like that here and have fun. 
    </h3>
